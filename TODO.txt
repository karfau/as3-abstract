//TODO: what about checking abstract methods (would introduce desribeType-Reflection?)...
/*one way could be a check where the method that would get called is implemented.
- if the abstract class really implements the interface, it needs to implement all the mehtods
- [Abstract] would enable us to check if methods are implemnted
!evaluate possibilities with gains/flaws, maybe make this an extra version

//TODO: allow the same mechanism for extensions of existing classes that are not objects
//TODO: what about a "multiple Abstract-heirarchy", ...
/* a) is it enough to only check the last abstractClass?
b) if not, it would require all earlier abstract classes to allow access to the
abstractClass-constructor-parameter (this way implementiing classes could avoid the test
by setting a wrong class.)
